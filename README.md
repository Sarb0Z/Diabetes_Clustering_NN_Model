# Diabetes Clustering Model: Predicting Patient Return Timeframes
===========================================================

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetic patients returning for medical care within specific timeframes: less than 30 days, more than 30 days, or not at all. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of 100,000 diabetic patients spanning 15 years, the model identifies patterns and insights to categorize patients based on their predicted return behavior.

## Key Features

* **Predictive Clustering**: Employs machine learning algorithms to cluster patients into three distinct groups based on their predicted return timeframe.
* **Data-Driven Insights**: Uncovers hidden patterns and relationships within the extensive dataset, providing valuable insights into patient behavior.
* **Timeframe-Specific Predictions**: Delivers predictions tailored to three specific timeframes, enabling targeted interventions and resource allocation.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust and accurate clustering model that effectively predicts the return timeframe for diabetic patients. This information can be used to:

* **Improve Patient Care**: Identify high-risk patients who are likely to return soon and provide timely interventions to prevent complications.
* **Optimize Resource Allocation**: Allocate resources efficiently by anticipating the demand for medical services based on predicted return patterns.
* **Enhance Preventive Measures**: Develop targeted outreach programs and educational initiatives to promote adherence to treatment plans and reduce the need for frequent visits.

## Deployment and Testing

### Deployment Guide

1. **Environment Setup**: Create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
2. **Data Preparation**: Prepare the dataset by performing necessary preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
3. **Model Training**: Train the chosen clustering model using the preprocessed training data.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using appropriate metrics such as silhouette score or Davies-Bouldin index.
5. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the trained model to a suitable environment for making predictions on new data.

### Testing and Benchmarking

* **Unit Tests**: Implement unit tests to ensure the correctness of individual functions and modules within the codebase.
* **Integration Tests**: Conduct integration tests to verify the seamless interaction between different components of the system.
* **Performance Benchmarking**: Measure the model's performance on different hardware configurations and dataset sizes to assess its efficiency and scalability.

**Note**: Please refer to the code files for detailed implementation details and specific instructions on running the project.
